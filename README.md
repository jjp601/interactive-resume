# Interactive Resume Project

The Interactive Resume project is a single page application I built to display my resume on the web and make a more user-friendly resume. The project uses the MVVM framework, KnockoutJS, to build the application. The goal of the project is to showcase my ability to use MV* frameworks to build web applications. You can expect more to come on this project.
